Welcome! This is a chrome extension that you can download to subscribe to channels and be notified instantly about new trailers that get uploaded to those channels! We are currently working on sending you instant notifications about any of your interests, so that when a basketball video gets uploaded to the ESPN channel or a news video about your city gets uploaded to NBC, you're the first to know!

5. Click load unpacked and select the code repository from where you downloaded it.
6. The extension should show up on your extensions page with the name 'YouTube-Notify.'
7. Select the extension from your extensions toolbar shortcut on the top of your screen and to the right (should be indicated by a puzzle piece icon).

To use the extension:

1. Click the 'edit' button and enter your email address for email notifications, then click 'save'.
2. Type a YouTube channel name in the 'Search Channels' field (will return most closely related matches).
